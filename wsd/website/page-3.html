        <p id="top-padding" class="introText">The one thing that I have always liked to do throughout my life so far is study new things that I have not learnt about yet or that I have very little knowledge at. One of the main ways that I was able to do this was through my education - below is a table holding the several different places of education I have attended and what I learnt there.</p>
